--- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialised it creates a (hidden) .git file that tracks the commits in the repository.


--- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a bridge between the working directory and the repository. It is where files to be committed are placed before the commit is completed.
